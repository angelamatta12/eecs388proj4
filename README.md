Start by running `./build.sh` to set up your targets. It will prompt 
for uniqnames. Enter all uniqnames in your group, separated by spaces.
Each groupâ€™s targets will be slightly different, so make sure your
uniqnames are correct!

We've provided `test.sh` to help check that your solutions match
the spec. However, this script is not the autograder, and it is not
authoritative. The spec (and autograder) has a few requirements beyond
what the script verifies, and it's up to you to test carefully.




NOTE: Using this code in order to do your assignments is against the honor code! It is not worth getting in trouble for it, they will not tell you if you got caught until after the class is done and all that work you did will be for nothing. Go to office hours instead. The purpose of making this repo public is for my potential employers to see it as I am applying for internships.
